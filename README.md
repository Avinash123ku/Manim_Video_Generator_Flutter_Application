# Flutter Chat PDF App

A sophisticated mobile application built with Flutter that enables intelligent conversations with PDF documents using gesture-based text extraction and AI-powered responses.

## Features

### üó£Ô∏è General Chat
- Direct conversation with AI without document context
- Clean, intuitive chat interface
- Message history with timestamps
- Real-time typing indicators

### üìÑ PDF Interaction
- Upload and view PDF documents
- **Gesture Mode**: Draw circles or highlight text to extract content
- Automatic text extraction from selected regions
- Smart mode switching between RAG and general LLM responses
- Visual feedback for gesture interactions

### üìö History
- Persistent storage of all conversations
- Organized by PDF document and timestamp
- Shows extracted text and final prompts
- Source tracking (PDF vs General chat)

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- **Riverpod** for reactive state management
- Separate providers for chat, PDF, and UI state
- Persistent storage using SharedPreferences

### PDF Processing
- **flutter_pdfview** for PDF rendering
- Custom gesture recognition for text selection
- Coordinate mapping for precise text extraction
- Offline PDF storage and management

### AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT integration with customizable endpoints
- Context-aware responses using RAG methodology
- Intelligent fallback to general LLM when needed
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
